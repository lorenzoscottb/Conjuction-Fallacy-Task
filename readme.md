# Conjuction Fallacy Task
Matlab script to collect participant's results on a basic Conjunction Fallacy task. 

Participants will see 82 sentencese, in a 41x2 design. Simuli are taken from the [supplemantary matherials](http://supp.apa.org/psycarticles/supplemental/rev0000047/rev0000047_supp.html) from the 2017 paper 
[' Associative Judgment and Vector Space Semantics '](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~bhatiasu/Bhatia%202017%20PsychReview.pdf)
from Bhatia

the task:
```bash
                                                      Welcome 
you will now see a series of short descriptions, they describe an hypotetical (and always difernt) person
