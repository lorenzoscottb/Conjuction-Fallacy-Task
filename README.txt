# Conjuction-Fallacy-Task
Matlab script to collect participant's results on a basic Conjunction Fallacy task. 

Participants will see 82 sentencese, in a 41x2 design. Simuli are taken from the supplemantary matherial from the 2017 paper 
' Associative Judgment and Vector Space Semantics ' from Bhatia
(http://supp.apa.org/psycarticles/supplemental/rev0000047/rev0000047_supp.html)
Output is a matlab matrix, named subj*.mat

the task:
                                                        Welcome

shortly after, you will be astrialed to matriale a judgements: say to wich of two categories the described person most probably  belongs belongs to.
